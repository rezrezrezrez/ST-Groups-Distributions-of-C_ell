# Sato-Tate Groups and Distributions of $y^{\ell} = x(x^{\ell}-1)$

This repository contains the code for [Sato-Tate Groups and Distributions of $y^{\ell} = x(x^{\ell}-1)$]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02522](https://www.impan.pl/en/publishing-house/journals-and-series/acta-arithmetica/online/116224/sato-tate-groups-and-distributions-of-y-ell-x-x-ell-1)) (Acta Arithmetica 2025). The code computes the characteristic polynomial coefficients from the Sato-Tate group of $C_{\ell}$, and calculates moment statistics associated with some of these coefficients.
