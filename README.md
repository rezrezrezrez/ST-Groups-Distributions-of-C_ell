# Sato-Tate Groups and Distributions of $y^{\ell} = x(x^{\ell}-1)$

This repository contains the code for "PUT PAPER LINK HERE" (arXiv 2024). The code computes the characteristic polynomial coefficients from the Sato-Tate group of $C_{\ell}$, and calculates moment statistics associated with some of the coefficients.
